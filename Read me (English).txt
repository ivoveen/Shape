The contents of this folder must be pasted into the htdocs folder found in the xxamp folder.

If this content has been pasted and the server has been turned on, go to the link http://localhost/initializeDB.php .

here you enter the code "1751".

This ensures that a database is automatically created with the correct fields and tables.
this also creates an user on phpmyadmin which is used by my website to modify the database.
This user has limited rights so that the website is better protected against hackers.

After you have entered the code and clicked on "(Re-)initialize Database", the button "visit the home page" will appear.
this button takes you directly to the main page of Shape. ( http://localhost/mainpage.php ).
 
from here you can click through to create an account and then log in. After this you will remain logged in and will be
automatically sent to the mainfeed page when you try go to the "log in" or "home" page.

(When logging in and creating an account, several safety nets are in place to avoid inconsistency.)

If you want to go back to the home page, you can log off by clicking on "log off".

Based on which account you are logged in, delete buttons will appear next to the post that your account has posted.
So if you log in with a different account, you can only delete the posts from that account.

Ultimately, the website is not completely secured because I didn't think it was necessary for this school project. An example of
the shortcoming is that the passwords are not hashed and stored in the database, which means the passwords
could be intercepted while sending and used to hack into accounts.
